# R0334-3003 Introduction to Mobile App Design and Development

This is my Ionic-Angular mobile app prototype for Laurea course R0334-3003 Introduction to Mobile App Design and Development. This course focuses on how to design mobile apps (UI/UX), and the use of Ionic framework. I will be updating my app throughout my Laurea course, and this project serves as a learning opportunity for me into cross platform mobile app development.
